## Technologies Used

- HTML5: For creating the structure and content of the website.
- CSS3: For responsive design and styling, including Flexbox for layout control and media queries for responsiveness.
- JavaScript: For interactive elements like the hamburger menu.

## Responsive Design

- On smaller screens (less than 1078px wide), the hamburger menu is shown, and clicking it reveals a vertical navigation menu.

   ``` bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jiteshiyu/Navbar.git
   ```
3. Open the project folder.

4. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the page.

## Usage
